--------
alphmask
--------

Program Description:
    The program takes an image and calculates an alphamask.
    The alphamask image is diplayed in an opengl window and
    can be saved with the w key.

Compilation:
    $> make

Use Cases:
    $> alphamask input.img output.img
    - Displays the input image with a calculated value for alpha
    - Saves image to output.img when the w key is pressed
    - Uses default values for alpha calculation

    $> alphamask input.img output.img hue_lower_bound hue_upper_bound
    - Displays the input image with a calculated value for alpha
    - Saves image to output.img when the w key is pressed
    - Uses hue_lower_bound and hue_upper_bound for alphamask calculation
    - hue_lower_bound and hue_upper_bound set a range for hue values of
      pixels that should have an alpha value of zero.
    - range for hue bound values is 0 - 360

Known Bugs:
    - If hue range is close to zero 0 or close to 360, the pixels with hues
      just outside the range will not have a

Additional Information:
    - Nothing from the advanced section is implemented

---------
composite
---------

Compilation:
    $> make

Program Description:
    The program takes two images and calculates A over B.
    The resulting image is displayed in an opengl window.
    If an ouput filename is specified on the command line,
    the program will write what is in the opengl window to
    the output file when the w key is pressed.

Use Cases:
    $> composite A.img B.img
    - Displays image A over image B in a opengl window

    $> composite A.img B.img output.img
    - Displays image A over image B in a opengl window
    - Saves image to output.img when the w key is pressed

Known Bugs:
    None

Additional Information:
    None

Steps to Create Submitted Composite of Dr. House
------------------------------------------------

    1. compile programs
        $> make

    2. Run alphamask with default hue bound settings
        $> alphamask dhouse.png output.png

    3. Save image with w key

    4. Run composite program with output.img from alphamask as A.img on command line
        $> composite output.png background.png final_composite.png

    5. Press w key to get final composite saved as final_composite.png
